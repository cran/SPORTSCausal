Description: A time series causal inference model for Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) under spillover effect. 'SPORTSCausal' (Spillover Time Series Causal Inference) separates treatment effect and spillover effect from given responses of experiment group and control group by predicting the response without treatment. It reports both effects by fitting the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model based on 'CausalImpact', as described in Brodersen et al. (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS788>.
